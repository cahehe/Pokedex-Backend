//first I created a package.json with the command below. The -y means skip the interactive process and say yes to all questions
npm init -y
//uncommented "outDir" and "rootDir" options in tsconfig so it nows where to compile and save compiled file with the tsc command

//install typescript if its not installed already
npm install typescript

//Then I installed express
npm install express 

//also nodemon and ts-node. -d indicates dev dependencies
npm installs -d nodemon ts-node

//since I'm using express with typescript I need to install it like this
npm install @types/express
